Didn't need it this time, but if we need to list all files via File.ListFolderAsync() - can pass "" to get root contents

In order to get the right path values though, you can list the contents of a folder using ListFolderAsync:

You can supply "" as the path to list the contents of the root folder, or any subfolder such as "/C#". You can then get the resulting 'PathLower' value for the desired file and use that in DownloadAsync.
